This repository is the implementation of the paper  
**Topology Design with Resource Allocation and Entanglement Distribution for Quantum Networks**

You may use requirements.txt to build your local environment, but it is not guaranteed to work as the python used by authors installs may unused packages and was used to test other projects. You may creat your own environment by installing main packages to a clean python, such as numpy, networkx, gurobipy (gurobi license required), pygeo, etc.
